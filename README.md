# GDrivePython

I used Google Drive API in Python, but the information and tutorials that Google provides was sparse.
As such, I am determined to make sample Python codes for Google API.
This github repository helps you build your own google drive apps with Python. Just like my other repositories, codes are straightforward.
I don't intend this repository to be the place where I can boast my coding skills. My goal is to make you understand how Google Drive API works in Python, and build your own apps with Python.

#gdrive.py

This file allows you to connect to Google Drive and download zip files and unzip in where you downloaded.
This python file functions like ZipExtractor in Google Chrome apps. This python code helps you understand how to download and upload files via Google Drive API with Python.
Feel free to ask me if you have any question.
I used Google Drive v3 API.
