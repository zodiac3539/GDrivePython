# GDrivePython

I used Google Drive API in Python, but the information was sparce. As such, I am determined to make sample Python codes for Google API.

#gdrive.py

This file allows you to connect to Google Drive and download first zip file in your Google drive.
Please, be sure that you have to download client_secret.json file from your Google API account.
